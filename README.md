# Japanese Translation App

This is an app that uses PaddleOCR to read images and translate Japanese text detected in the image into English.

## Overview

This readme provides an explanation of the necessary functions used in the app and how to use them, whether you run the app or use the functions separately.

## Requirements

Before using the app, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary packages used in the app.

## Features

1. Translation from Japanese to English.
2. Tracking the number of Japanese characters translated per account, displayed in a bar graph format.
3. Ability to either upload an image for translation or capture an image directly.
4. Deletion of all files used by the end of the session.
5. Option to save the image with translated text overlaid.
6. User registration and login.

# OCR Program (`ocr.py`)

This file processes images to extract, translate, and annotate Japanese text. It includes functions for OCR, tokenization, and drawing translated text on images.

## Functions Overview

### 1. `process_image(image_path)`

**Purpose:**  
Processes an input image, extracts Japanese text using OCR, tokenizes the text, and translates it into English.

**How to use:**

```python
your_image_path = './data/w.jpg'
df = process_image('your_image_path')
print(df)
```

The function returns a pandas DataFrame containing:
- `Box`: Bounding boxes of detected text.
- `Japanese`: Original Japanese text.
- `Translated`: Translated text in English.
- `Tokens`: Tokenized Japanese words.
- `Romaji`: Romanized versions of the words.
- `Translated_Tokens`: Translated tokens in English.

### 2. `draw_translated_text(image_path, df)`

**Purpose:**  
Draws the translated text onto the original image and saves it.

**How to use:**

```python
output_image_path = draw_translated_text('your_image_path', df)
print(f"Image saved at {output_image_path}")
```

- `image_path`: The original image file.
- `df`: DataFrame from `process_image()` containing the text to be added.
- The function saves the image with the translated text and returns the path to the saved image.

### 3. `delete_saved_image(file_path)`

**Purpose:**  
Deletes the specified image file.

**How to use:**

```python
delete_saved_image('your_image_path')
```

# User Authentication and Database Management Tool (`server.py`)

This file handles user registration, login, and management of daily data using SQLite and sockets.

## Functions Overview

### 1. `register(username, password)`

**Purpose:**  
Registers a new user by hashing their password and storing the username and hashed password in the SQLite database.

**How to use:**

```python
status = register('username', 'password')
if status:
    print("Registration successful")
else:
    print("Registration failed")
```

### 2. `login(username, password)`

**Purpose:**  
Verifies the user's credentials by comparing the hashed password stored in the database with the provided password.

**How to use:**

```python
status, user_id = login('username', 'password')
if status:
    print(f"Login successful. User ID: {user_id}")
else:
    print("Login failed")
```

### 3. `update_daily_data(username, data_date, data_value)`

**Purpose:**  
Updates the user's daily data by either inserting a new record or adding the new data to the existing record in the `daily_data` table.

**How to use:**

```python
status = update_daily_data('username', '2024-09-07', 50.0)
if status:
    print("Daily data updated")
else:
    print("Update failed")
```

### 4. `get_daily_data(username)`

**Purpose:**  
Fetches daily data for the specified user, returning the username, date, and data value.

**How to use:**

```python
data = get_daily_data('username')
print(data)
```

# Data Logging and Character Counting Tool (`datalog.py`)

This file processes the output from OCR, counts characters, and logs daily data. It interacts with other modules such as `ocr.py`, `file_handling.py`, and `server.py` for various functionalities.

## Functions Overview

### 1. `separate_and_count_characters(df)`

**Purpose:**  
Separates each character from the Japanese text and counts the total number of characters, including the successfully translated ones.

**How to use:**

```python
df = process_image('path_to_image.jpg')
chara_count, timestamp = separate_and_count_characters(df)
print(f"Character Count: {chara_count}, Timestamp: {timestamp}")
```

- `df`: A pandas DataFrame containing the OCR results, including Japanese text and translated text.
- Returns the total number of characters and the current timestamp.

### Integration with Other Modules

- `ocr.py`: The `process_image()` and `draw_translated_text()` functions are imported to process images and extract the text.
- `file_handling.py`: The `create_bar_graph()` function is used to create visual representations of the data.
- `server.py`: The `update_daily_data()` function is used to log the daily data into the SQLite database.

### Example Usage

1. **Process an image and count characters:**

```python
df = process_image('image_path.jpg')
chara_count, timestamp = separate_and_count_characters(df)
```

2. **Update daily data:**

```python
update_daily_data('username', timestamp, chara_count)
```

3. **Create a bar graph from the data:**

```python
x, y = fetch_graphing_data('username')
create_bar_graph(x, y)
```
